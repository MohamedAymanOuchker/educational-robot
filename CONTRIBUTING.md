- **Alternatives considered**

### Code Contributions üíª

#### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Clone your fork:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/educational-robot-esp32.git
   cd educational-robot-esp32
   ```

3. **Set up development environment:**

   **For Firmware:**
   ```bash
   # Install PlatformIO
   pip install platformio
   cd firmware/
   pio run
   ```

   **For Mobile App:**
   ```bash
   # Install Flutter
   cd mobile-app/
   flutter pub get
   flutter run
   ```

#### Coding Standards

**Firmware (C++):**
- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Follow Arduino coding style
- Comment complex algorithms
- Keep functions under 50 lines when possible
- Use descriptive variable names

```cpp
// Good
void calculateMotorSteps(int distanceCM) {
  int steps = (distanceCM * 10.0 / wheelCircumference) * stepsPerRev;
  // Implementation...
}

// Avoid
void calc(int d) {
  int s = (d * 10.0 / wc) * spr;
  // Implementation...
}
```

**Mobile App (Dart/Flutter):**
- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Follow Dart style guide
- Use meaningful widget names
- Implement proper error handling
- Add comments for complex UI logic

```dart
// Good
class ProgrammingBlockWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  final BlockModel block;
  final VoidCallback onTap;
  
  const ProgrammingBlockWidget({
    Key? key,
    required this.block,
    required this.onTap,
  }) : super(key: key);
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Implementation...
  }
}
```

#### Commit Guidelines

Use conventional commit format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(firmware): add emergency stop functionality
fix(app): resolve BLE connection timeout issue
docs(hardware): update assembly guide with new images
```

#### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following coding standards

3. **Test thoroughly:**
   - Hardware: Test on actual ESP32
   - Software: Test on different devices
   - Educational: Consider impact on learning

4. **Update documentation** if needed

5. **Create pull request** with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Link to related issues
   - Screenshots/videos if UI changes
   - Testing instructions

6. **Respond to feedback** from maintainers
